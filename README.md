Patches for the Oculus Rift SDK
===============================

Things I noticed and patched. Since Oculus development does not have a git
repo anywhere to clone and send pull requests, I'll put out these patches here
and let people pick them up as wished.

The toplevel subdirectory is just the version number of the Oculus SDK.
Inside there is a README.md with a listing of all patches with their names - 
and the corresponding patches as single files.

Note: these are the patches against the Linux version of the SDK (ovr_sdk_linux),
but I assume, things are similar in the other versions.
